print("""\nHELLO FROM FooVirus\n\n

This is a demonstration of how easy it is to write

a self-replicating program. This virus will infect

all files with names ending in .foo in the directory in

which you execute an infected file.  If you send an

infected file to someone else and they execute it, their,

foo files will be damaged also.



Note that this is a safe virus (for educational purposes

only) since it does not carry a harmful payload.  All it
#Hello from test.
#Hello from test2. 
#I am inside tmp directory.
#FooVirus can't infect me.
